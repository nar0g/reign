# reign 1.2
Classic Battle Net bot that connects to Warcraft 2 and Diablo II.

# Info:

Reign started out as GChat back in 2006 when I (Goran) created the project. Originally I just wanted to just make a basic chat bot that only worked on Warcraft 2 because at the time I had a shit ton of W2BN CD-Keys and the fact that W2BN had not been updated in ages which just made it the much easier to create. I later renamed the project Reign and ended up adding database thanks to cHiP[L] from Op Legacy.
